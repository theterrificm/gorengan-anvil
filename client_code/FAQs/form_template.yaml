                  <h2 class="font-large font-bold mb-10">How would a patron to my establishment interact with this product?</h2>
                  <p class="font-normal text-green">The patron would use their smart phone or tablet to scan the QR code with their camera app. A web browser window will automatically open and show them the sign they are looking at, translated into whatever language their device is set to.  No downloads, no app, no additional software required.</p>
              </li>
              <li>

                  <h2 class="font-large font-bold mb-10">How do I add a new sign to my account?</h2>
                  <p class="font-normal text-green">Simply snap a clear photo of the sign which you want to add to your account.  From there, click `Add New Sign` and select the photo you just took.  You can even use built in AI to scan the text from the sign automatically.  After that, you can immediately attach the generated QR code onto your existing signage.</p>

                  <p class="font-normal text-green">Unlike Google Translate, SignSafe Tech is a fully automated service that requires no input or action from the end user besides scanning a QR code with a device and app that they already have.  We require no additional app, no login, and no configuration needed for your patrons to get the sign translated.</p>
